## Contributing

:+1::tada: Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great. :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Atos Design System and its packages, which are hosted in the [ATOS-DESIGN Organization](https://github.com/ATOS-DESIGN) on GitHub.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Atom Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

> **Note:** Please don't file an issue to ask a question. You'll get faster results by using the resources below.

We have an official message board where the community chimes in with helpful advice if you have questions.

- [Github Discussions, the official Atos Design System message board](https://github.com/orgs/ATOS-DESIGN/discussions)

## What should I know before I get started?

### Atos Design System and Packages

Atos Design System is project made up of [multiple repositories](https://github.com/ATOS-DESIGN). When you initially consider contributing to the Atos Design System, you might be unsure about which of those repositories implements the functionality you want to change or report a bug for. This section should help you with that.

- [@atos-design/web](https://github.com/ATOS-DESIGN/web) - monorepo for the Atos Design System web components. It is the source for both the `@atos-design/core` and `@atos-design/components` packages.
- [@atos-design/icons](https://github.com/ATOS-DESIGN/icons) - the icons that can be used with the Atos Design System through the `@atos-design/icons` package.
- [@atos-design/playground](https://github.com/ATOS-DESIGN/playground) - For any kind of research and experimentation
- [@atos-design/welcome](https://github.com/ATOS-DESIGN/welcome) - tne welcome page for the Atos Design System

There are more, but this list should be a good starting point.

### Design ðŸŽ¨

Every part of the Atos Design System is carefully crafted and reviewed by our design team before being implemented.
It will be documented in our [Design Documentation](https://www.figma.com/file/E91x6A8TrQ5vyB8yZmMprj/Non-Alcatraz-Design-Library)
If you have a question around how we design things, check to see if it is documented there. If it is _not_ documented there, please open a new topic on [Github Discussions, the official Atos Design System message board](https://github.com/orgs/ATOS-DESIGN/discussions) and ask your question.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the Atos Design System. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](https://github.com/ATOS-DESIGN/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- **Check the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ATOS-DESIGN/discussions)** for a list of common questions and problems.
- **Determine [which repository the problem should be reported in](#atos-design-system-and-packages)**.
- **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+org%3AATOS-DESIGN** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#atos-design-system-and-packages) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/ATOS-DESIGN/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you use the Atos design System, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you included the Atos Design System otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut, and if so which one?
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
- **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a [performance profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/evaluate-performance/) or a [heap snapshots](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/memory-problems/heap-snapshots with your report.
- **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

- **Can you reproduce the problem?**
- **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of the Atos Design System) or was this always a problem?
- If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of the Atos Design System?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of the Atos Design System from [the releases page](https://github.com/ATOS-DESIGN/web/releases).
- **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

- **Which version of the Atos Design System are you using?** You can get the exact version from the package-lock.json file in your project.
- **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
- **Which [packages](#atos-design-system-and-packages) do you have installed?**.
- **Are you using the Atos Design System with multiple monitors?** If so, can you reproduce the problem when you use a single monitor?
- **Which keyboard layout are you using?** Are you using a US layout or some other layout?
